### Core Value Proposition
- Identify if businesses are getting value from their SEO investment
- Highlight missed opportunities and content gaps vs competitors
- Show authority links gap between scanned site and top competitors
- Show keyword/topic theme traffic gap between scanned site and top competitors
- Provide actionable insights with AI-powered commentary
- Generate qualified leads for The SEO Show's sales team

### Target Audience
- Service businesses (legal, medical, home services, etc.)
- Currently investing in SEO (minimum 6 months, $1000+/month)
- Business owners/marketing managers seeking ROI validation
