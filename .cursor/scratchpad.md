# SEO ROI Assessment Tool - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation (Revised)

### Project Overview
A free lead generation tool for The SEO Show podcast that assesses service businesses' SEO campaign performance and ROI. Users input their domain, SEO investment details, and conversion metrics to receive a comprehensive analysis comparing their results against expected benchmarks and competitor performance.

### Core Value Proposition
- Identify if businesses are getting value from their SEO investment
- Highlight missed opportunities and content gaps vs competitors
- Show authority links gap between scanned site and top competitors
- Show keyword/topic theme traffic gap between scanned site and top competitors
- Provide actionable insights with AI-powered commentary
- Generate qualified leads for The SEO Show's sales team

### Target Audience
- Service businesses (legal, medical, home services, etc.)
- Currently investing in SEO (minimum 6 months, $1000+/month)
- Business owners/marketing managers seeking ROI validation

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript (clean intake flow only - no sales copy)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for PDF reports
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Background Jobs**: Supabase Edge Functions with queue system
- **AI Analysis**: Claude API for personalized commentary
